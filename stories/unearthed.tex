\chapter{Thresholds}

It had been a long day, but the top of the mountain was finally in sight.
\vocab{1}, \vocab{2} and \vocab{3} were breathing heavily, their feet sore and their backs sodden with sweat. But despite this, they grinned at each other.

\begin{dialogue}
\item "There it is" \vocab{1} let out, almost not believing the words coming out of his mouth.
\item "I told you, didn't I?" said \vocab{3}, clapping \vocab{1} on the shoulder, "Didn't I tell him, \vocab{2}?"
\end{dialogue}

\vocab{2} sighed in equal parts relief that their goal was now in sight, and \vocab{3}'s insistence. He would be unbearable, but he had been right. 
They had found the \vocab{4} at last. Their long search had come to an end.

% Back story 

% Decide to spend the night outside as it's late. 
% Around the fire, they each think about what's lead them to this point.

% In the morning, they wake having slept badly due to intense nightmares.
% (Galen kept watch, and also wandered around, finding the messages left by family members and friends to those who died)
% He informs them of these and they have misgivings, but enter anyway.
