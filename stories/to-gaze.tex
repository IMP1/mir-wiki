\chapter{First Steps}

To say that Alkesia's early life had been challenging would be an understatement.
She came screaming out of the womb and never seemed to stop. 
At first, her family thought it was funny, and would affectionately call her 'Wail', yet as time went on, they began to become concerned.

She would not sleep, which was not unheard of for a newborn midnighter, but was unusual, and was never a good sign. 
Those who did not sleep, it was said, would be taken back to the realms of before-being and after-being. 
For it is only once you sleep in a place that you can be said to reside there.
