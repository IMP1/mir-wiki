\chapter{The Eastern Road}

The road from the capital to the Eastern lands of Ridgeback takes you through many places. 
Some large and grand, like the bustling market town of Rifford where all manner of goods can be found, or the winding uphill road that crests with such a view of the seas and cliffs that countless songs have been written about.
Some are smaller, and humbler, like the small village of Berrywood. But even humble villages are taxed by the lords of Ridgeback. 

\vocab{1} had been sent to Berrywood for that very purpose. With him were his escort: two shabbily dressed soldiers wearing the royal colours who were, unfortunately for \vocab{1}, the finest that could be spared for the tedious task of accompanying a tax collector.

\begin{dialogue}
\item "I hope they've food when we arrive." grumbled the smaller of the two guards.
\item "I hope they've a decent bed" replied the other, weary of both the road and the conversation they had repeated almost every hour since leaving Rifford.
\end{dialogue}

\vocab{1} had gone through many stages of feelings towards his two companions, and was now in one of mild amusement.

\begin{dialogue}
\item "Come now \vocab{2}, your breakfast this morning was the largest I've seen!"
\end{dialogue}
