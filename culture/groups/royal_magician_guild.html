                    <p>
                            This group of magically endowed people serve the crown. 
                            Often they are sent across Ridgeback as they can communicate with each other magically.
                            They serve their towns with healing magic and advise the town's mayor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    All magicians of <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ridgeback.html">Ridgeback</a> are expected to join the Guild.
                    Members have to follow rules involving the types of effects their magic can have.
                    Members are also ostensibly protected from the social persecution other magicians face.
                    There are some magicians who do not join the guild, or who leave, but they are often cast out from society.
