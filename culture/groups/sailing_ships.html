                    <h2>Roles</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are the more common roles that members of a ship's crew would take on. Often some of these would be combined and would be carried out by a singular crew member.

                            Since the maps were often innacurate, this job was difficult, and the more ambitious navigators would attempt to update their maps.

                            The master's prentice will check for quantities and any problems with the equipment, and will report to the master when at port.

                            Pirate ships often have an elected representative to handle sharing of the loot who is second in authority only to the captain.

                            They are also in charge of the use of the sails, and other on-deck activities, including dropping and raising the anchor.

                        <dd>
                            All other crew members are considered on the same level, and often rotate their responsibilities, and so need to have a variety of skills. 
                            Sailors must be able to read the skies and weather, and steer the ship, and work the rigging and sails. 
                            Sailors also are expected to cook, and clean, and help out the more specialised crew with their tasks.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Weatherworker</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Some crews have a position of a weatherworker, other will trade passage for weatherworking. 
                            Weatherworkers will use their magical skills to allow the ship safer or faster travel by manipulating the local weather systems. 
                            On longer journeys, or for less powerful magicians, weatherworkers will reserve their magical energies for more threatening situations.
