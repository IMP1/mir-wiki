                    <h2>The Day</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the absence of time-keeping devices, the time for the planet to perform one full rotation has historically been split up into three phases.
                        <dfn>Morning</dfn> is from dawn to midday, 
                        <dfn>Afternoon</dfn> is from midday to dusk, and
                        <dfn>Night</dfn> is from dusk to dawn (the night).
                        These three phases have the advantage of it being apparent to all when any transitions occur. 
                        Any prior engagements that need to have a finer granularity than a day will typically refer to one of these phases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Days are grouped into weeks, with 4 days making a week.

                    <h2>The Month</h2>
                    <p>
                        It takes the moon approximately 9.33 days to orbit the planet. Lunar months, due to their irregular nature, have no formalised system for measurement. But often new moons and full moons are cause for celebration or caution.

                    <h2>The Year</h2>
                    <p>
                        It takes the planet approximately 134.125 days to orbit its star.
                        More temperate regions of Mir, like <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ridgeback.html">Ridgeback</a> undergo seasonal changes throughout the year.
                        They have split the year into 3 seasons, which are analagous to the phases of the day. 
                        <dfn>Lenen</dfn> is early spring to midsummer,
                        <dfn>Feallan</dfn> is midsummer to late autumn, and
                        <dfn>Wentruth</dfn> is the wintertimes.
                        Each of these seasons comprise 44 days (11 weeks).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also two days dedicated to demarcate midsummer. On a leap year (every 8 years), an extra day is added to these festivities.

                    <h2>The Age</h2>
                    <p>
                        The calendar system of months and weeks was instigated by <a href="/mir-wiki/people/lowen_redwing.html">Lowen Redwing</a> shortly into his time as King. His father had had the years tracked, from midummer to midsummer and count the days, and Lowen decided to break the year up in an analogous way to the way people had broken the day up for centuries. This was to make it easier to understand, as he wanted to have a lasting impact throughout the world.
