                    <h2>The Day</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the absence of time-keeping devices, the time for the planet to perform one full rotation has historically been split up into three phases.
                        <dfn>Morning</dfn> is from dawn to midday, 
                        <dfn>Afternoon</dfn> is from midday to dusk, and
                        <dfn>Night</dfn> is from dusk to dawn (the night).
                        These three phases have the advantage of it being apparent to all when any transitions occur. 
                        Any prior engagements that need to have a finer granularity than a day will typically refer to one of these phases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Days are grouped into weeks, with 4 days making a week.

                    <h2>The Month</h2>
                    <p>
                        It takes the moon --- days to orbit the planet. Lunar months, due to their irregular nature, have no formalised system for measurement. But often new moons and full moons are cause for celebration or caution.

                    <h2>The Year</h2>
                    <p>
                        It takes the planet --- days to orbit its star.
                        More temperate regions of Mir, like <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ridgeback.html">Ridgeback</a> undergo seasonal changes throughout the year.
                        They have split the year into 3 seasons, which are analagous to the phases of the day. 
                        <dfn>---</dfn> is early spring to midsummer,
                        <dfn>---</dfn> is midsummer to late autumn, and
                        <dfn>---</dfn> is the wintertimes.
                        Each seasons is split into 2 calendar months (roughly the same duration as, but not linked to, a lunar month).

                        <dfn>---</dfn> is the second month of ...

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also two days dedicated to demarcate the beginning of a new year. On a leap year, an extra day is added to these festivities.
