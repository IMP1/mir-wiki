                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                            There is a story about a whale whose song drew ships to it, to their demise. 
                            There were few survivors, and of those, even fewer were believed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Over the years, the story dissolved into myths and songs.

                            Once there sailed a ship <br>
                            The finest ever were <br>
                            The <em>Gliding Swallow</em>, and she did <br>
                            Through the sea as through the air <br>

                                                Heard the singing whale  <br>
                                                As it began to call <br>

                        The sea it turned them round <br>

                        They could get her back <br>

                        From whence the singing came <br>
                        And saw just other ships <br>

                    <h2>The Real Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the first <a href="/mir-wiki/biology/fauna/cephalopods.html">cephalopod</a> attacks on land-dwelling ships.
                        They convinced one whale to sing, and used it as a beacon. They then used other whales to create waves moving towards the singing whale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was to generally discourage ships from sailing across the seas to the east of 
                        <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/the_sisters_islands.html">The Sisters</a>, which was a preferred route due to prevailing winds.
                        Cephalopods felt like the ships were encroaching upon their space, scaring off their prey, and polluting the water with their excrement.
