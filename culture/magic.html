                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                            Some objects are imbued with magical properties or powers.
                            This is uncommon and is usually a result of a tear between the Material and the Abyss.
                            Sometimes these tears occur randomly and "naturally", and sometimes they are created by beings from either plane.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Magical energies can create phonomena that would seem otherwise physically impossible.
                    Energies and matter moving across the planes appears to be created, 
                    destroyed or moved instantaneously.

                    <h2>Magic Users</h2>
                    <p>
                            Some people can use magic to affect the world. 
                            These people are very few and far between, and they are feared by almost everyone else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    They are, however, very powerful. Which people see as useful. In <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ridgeback.html">Ridgeback</a>, there is a <a href="/mir-wiki/culture/groups/royal_magician_guild.html">Guild of Magicians</a> who are approved by the King, and who perform royal duties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some races are more highly tuned to the magical energies, but all are potential hosts. <a href="/mir-wiki/biology/fauna/midnighters.html">Midnighters</a> are the most highly tuned of the sapient animals of Mir, but some more wild animals have more affinity to the Abyss.
