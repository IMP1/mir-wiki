                        <h3>Childhood</h3>
                        <p>
                            The son of a rich family. Gail was raised into a life of ease. A slight lad, his youth was spent training with a bow rather than in armour. He loved to hunt for both the archery challenge and for the satisfaction of observing the world and trailing an animal. He was also aware growing up of the political intrigue his family was embroiled in. Talk at the dinner table was often of serious adult matters spoken about indirectly and so he learnt to understand what people meant even if it might not be what they were saying.
