        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Sand Flats is the southern-most region of <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ridgeback.html">Ridgeback</a>.
            Its capital is <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/winwick.html">Winwick</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to its barren landscape, there isn't much life, and so settlements tend to spring up around sources of water.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is ruled by <a href="/mir-wiki/people/???_horlay.html">??? Horlay</a>.
