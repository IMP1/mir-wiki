                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                            The village of Berrywood is small, and its people are inward-looking. They have little dealings with outsiders and so have little trust for unknown faces.

                    <p>
                    It is located in a valley by the wood, also called Berrywood. Streams run through the forest and form a river running down the hill. The village is nestled in a bend in the river. The occasional traveller will approach from the west, and will usually cross the river a short was into the forest, in a small clearing where the river is lower. This clearing is known as <strong>Summerford Grove</strong>, and people from the village will walk to the grove for spiritual festivals.

                        A road passes through Berrywood, crossing the river at a low point in the hills to its west. This road goes to <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ashvale_city.html">Rifford</a> to the west, and to <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/dawnstar_bay.html">Dawnstar Bay</a> to the east.

                    <p>
                        The village keeps goats for milk, and for their meat and hides. People forage from, and hunt in, the wood.
                        A few regular traders will occassionally visit the village, looking to trade tools for berry wine.

                    <h2>The Wood</h2>
                    <p>
                        The wood mostly comprises ??? and ??? trees. The lower layers contain an abundance of <a href="/mir-wiki/biology/flora/frostberries.html">frostberries</a> berries, hence the name.
                        The residents of Berrywood ferment these berries into wine, which cools down the drinker slightly, which is refreshing in the summer months, but can also be useful to medical procedures.
