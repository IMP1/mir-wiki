                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                            The village of Berrywood is small, and its people are inward-looking. They have little dealings with outsiders and so have little trust for unknown faces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It is located in a valley underneath the wood, also called Berrywood. Streams run through the forest and form a river running down the hill. The village is nestled in a bend in the river. The occasional traveller will approach from the south, and will usually cross the river a short was into the forest, in a small clearing where the river is lower. This clearing is known as <strong>Summerford Grove</strong>, and people from the village will walk to the grove for spiritual festivals.

                    <p>
                            The village is officially under the protection of the king, and so are under obligation to pay taxes to the monarchy, They pay this grumbling, however, as they see little benefit to these taxes. They are remote, and so recieve little-to-no protection, and recieve little benefit of the services that the taxes are spent on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A road passes through Berrywood, crossing the river at a low point in the hills to its west. This road goes to <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ashvale_city.html">Ashvale</a> to the south, along with all the towns and villages and farms further south, and to <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/dawnstar_bay.html">Dawnstar Bay</a> to the east.
