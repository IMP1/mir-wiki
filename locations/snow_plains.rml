        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Snow Plains occupy the northern-most part of <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ridgeback.html">Ridgeback</a>, 
            on the western side of the <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/hackle.html">Hackle</a>.
            There are few settlements, with the largest being <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/northwaite.html">Northwaite</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is ruled by the five largest families, each ruling a portion of the region. 
            In the harsh north, cooperation is essential to the survival of all, so there is relatively little in-fighting.
            These five families share a banner in solidarity.
