        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Estearth was subsumed into <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ashvale_region.html">Ashvale</a> in the <a href="/mir-wiki/events/war_for_ridgeback.html">War for Ridgeback</a>. It remains sparsely inhabited, as its capital, <a href="Proudwatch">Proudwatch (then First Morn)</a> was destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            People still refer to the lands as Estearth, but it is owned and managed by the <a href="/mir-wiki/people/jason_hornehill.html">Lord of Ashvale</a>, who is also the King of <a href="/mir-wiki/locations/ridgeback.html">Ridgeback</a>.
