                        What are the downsides to magic? Why can't it just solve every problem?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe it's incredibly dangerous if done wrong, and so you need lots of careful training (or incredible luck) to get well practised enough to get good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe it's really tiring? Maybe too much magic too quickly makes you crazy? Maybe sometimes it just doesn't work, so it's unreliable? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe it requires concentration (which it ostensibly does) and/or ingredients (yep...), etc. Read the player's handbook I guess.
